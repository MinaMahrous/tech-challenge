  Situation:
	This Nagios check plugin is a POC, checking the text file /tmp/hdd_status.
    The file /tmp/hdd_status should be existing on all servers, and should be
    kept up to date by a script executed hourly by cron.
  Goal:
    Please make the plugin Production ready to be rolled out on to all our servers.
  There are some typical problems with this type of monitoring that have to be
  addressed in the code.
  This implies:
    - Catch common problems before they happen in Production.
    - Proof read the existing lines of code.
    - Improve/rewrite the code where you think it is necessary.
      (You do not have to use Python, feel free to use the scripting language of your choice)
    - Add comments where useful, in order to explain:
        - Your reasoning.
        - Foreseeable risks with your approach.
        - Suggestions of how something should be done ideally.
